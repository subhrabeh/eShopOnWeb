# üìå Monitoring & Observability Principles (Generic)

### 1. **End-to-End Visibility**

* Cover all layers: **infrastructure, OS, runtime, database, application, integrations, and business processes**.
* Avoid blind spots by ensuring each layer is observable.

---

### 2. **Business Relevance**

* Monitoring should reflect **business outcomes**, not just technical health.
* Example: ‚ÄúOrders processed per hour‚Äù is more meaningful than just ‚ÄúCPU utilization‚Äù.

---

### 3. **Proactive Detection**

* Set thresholds and anomaly detection to **catch issues early**, before they impact users.
* Example: Alert on growing queue backlog before it causes service delays.

---

### 4. **Signal-to-Noise Balance**

* Collect **useful, not excessive** data.
* Reduce alert fatigue by defining **severity levels** (Critical, High, Warning, Info).

---

### 5. **Correlation & Context**

* Link metrics, logs, and traces to provide **context across systems**.
* Use transaction IDs or correlation keys to trace workflows end-to-end.

---

### 6. **Actionable Alerts**

* Every alert should have a **clear meaning, owner, and response path**.
* Avoid generic alerts that lead to confusion or are consistently ignored.

---

### 7. **Automation & Self-Healing**

* Automate common recovery actions where possible (restart service, scale resources).
* Reduce manual effort and improve resilience.

---

### 8. **Unified View**

* Strive for a **single pane of glass** that consolidates infra, app, and business metrics.
* Prevent siloed monitoring (e.g., infra team sees one thing, app team another).

---

### 9. **Trend Analysis & Capacity Planning**

* Keep historical data for trend analysis.
* Use it to forecast capacity needs, prevent resource exhaustion, and plan scaling.

---

### 10. **Continuous Improvement**

* After every incident, review what monitoring was missing or delayed.
* Adjust thresholds, add metrics, and evolve dashboards to keep pace with system and business changes.
